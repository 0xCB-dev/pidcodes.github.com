BADGE.TEAM is a group of people developing electronic conference badges.
We've created the hardware for the SHA2017, HackerHotel 2019 & 2020 and MCH2022 badges
as well as a universal software platform powering not only our own but also a whole list of other conference badges such as the
[Disobey.fi 2019 and 2020](https://disobey.fi/), [CampZone 2019 and 2020](https://campzone.nl/) and [Troopers 2022](https://troopers.de/) badges.

Documentation about our projects can be found at [docs.badge.team](https://docs.badge.team).
