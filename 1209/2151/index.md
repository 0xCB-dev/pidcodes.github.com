The Sensor Watch is a board replacement for the classic Casio F-91W wristwatch. It is powered by a Microchip SAM L22 microcontroller with built-in segment LCD controller. You can write your own programs for the watch using the provided watch library, program the watch over USB using the built-in [UF2 bootloader](https://pid.codes/1209/2150/), and then install the board in your existing watch case to run your own software on your wrist.
